Working in /Users/lsd/msclaude/projects/heygen clone - Add voice preview system. Create public/assets/voices/ with voices.json metadata for 10 voices: Rachel (Professional Female), Adam (Professional Male), Domi (Energetic Female), Josh (Warm Male), Bella (Young Female), Antoni (Narrator Male), Elli (Friendly Female), Arnold (Deep Male), Emily (British Female), Matilda (American Female). Each with characteristics (pitch, speed, accent, tone, use-case). Update public/app.js with real voice preview player using Web Audio API for waveform visualization. Add audio player UI component with play/pause, waveform display. No need for actual audio files - create simulated preview.
